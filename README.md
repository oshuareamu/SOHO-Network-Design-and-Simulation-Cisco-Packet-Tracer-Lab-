# SOHO-Network-Design-and-Simulation-Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Lab-
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network consists of switches, hosts, and router, configured for basic connectivity and IP addressing.
# Network Topology
- 1 Router (for inter-VLAN and internet access)
- 2 Switches (to segment the network and connect hosts)
- 4 PCs (Hosts) connected to the switches
